<a name="description"><b>Description:</b></a> <br />
&emsp;The player acts as a pilot and must find the enemy who is using a maginfying  <br />
glass to destroy the world. The player can choose two different levels to attack the <br />
boss at. Those levels are water and land. My contributions were the enemy's design, <br />
enemy targeting, contributions and control screen, and designing the water level. <br />

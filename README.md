&emsp;This is the final project for University of Nevada, Reno's Game Engine Architecture Course. In this project, the player is a fighter pilot who must destroy the enemy player while also avoid the enemy's turrets. Once the player has entered the enemy turret's line of sight, the turret's will turn to where the player be and intercept them. Once the player finds the enemy boss and eliminates it, then the game will end in a victory state where the player will return to the main menu.
